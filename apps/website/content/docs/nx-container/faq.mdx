### INPUT_BUILD_ARGS is not working

It's a common use case to pass build arguments to the docker command using environment variables, so the first thing you would run is something like this

```bash
INPUT_BUILD_ARGS=NODE_VERSION=24.0.0,NODE_ENV=production nx run node-app:container
```

But as you can notice, it do not work as you expect ðŸ˜¢

The problem is because both variables should be separated by a new line instead a comma and you have two ways to do it

#### Using dotenv

Create a `.env` file in the root of the workspace with this content

```bash
INPUT_BUILD_ARGS="NODE_VERSION=24.0.0\nNODE_ENV=production"
```

Take a look of the `\n` between both variables, then run `nx run node-app:container`

#### Inline execution

Sadly, the string of the first option not work if you try to run `INPUT_BUILD_ARGS="NODE_VERSION=24.0.0\nNODE_ENV=production" nx run node-app:container`, in this case you need to use a new line instead of `\n` like the below image
