## @nx-tools/nx-container:configuration

This generator is used for setup a existing app to use `nx-container`.

It will create a `Dockerfile` file at the root of your project, or if there's already a `Dockerfile` file, it will be replaced with a new one based on your template selection.

It will also add the `container` target to the `project.json` file of your project if is required.

<Callout title="Your code will be modified!" type="error">
