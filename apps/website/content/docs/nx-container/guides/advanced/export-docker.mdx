description: Make your Docker image available in the Docker client.

You may want your build result to be available in the Docker client through docker images to be able to use it in another step of your workflow:

```json title="apps/your-app/project.json"
"container": {
  "executor": "@nx-tools/nx-container:build",
  "options": {
    "load": true,
    "tags": [
      "user/app:latest",
    ],
  }
}
```
