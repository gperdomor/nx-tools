You can build [multi-platform](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/) images using the `platforms` option, as shown in the following example:

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  List of available platforms will be displayed and available through our [setup-buildx](https://github.com/docker/setup-buildx-action#about) action.

  If you want support for more platforms, you can use QEMU with our [setup-qemu](https://github.com/docker/setup-qemu-action) action.
