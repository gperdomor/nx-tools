description: How to push your Docker image to multiple registries using Nx Container
---

The following workflow will connect you to Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry, and push the image to both registries

```json title="apps/your-app/project.json"
"container": {
  "executor": "@nx-tools/nx-container:build",
  "options": {
    "push": true,
    "tags": [
      "user/app:latest",
      "user/app:1.0.0",
      "ghcr.io/user/app:latest",
      "ghcr.io/user/app:1.0.0"
    ],
  }
}
```
