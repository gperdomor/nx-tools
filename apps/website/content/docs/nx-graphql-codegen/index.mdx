The `@nx-tools/nx-graphql-codegen` plugin delivers a complete GraphQL code generation integration for Nx monorepos, offering streamlined development workflows, automated type generation from GraphQL schemas, and powerful tooling that scales with your GraphQL application architecture.

## Key Features

- **GraphQL Code Generator Integration**: Complete integration with the popular GraphQL Code Generator toolkit
- **Type-Safe Development**: Automatically generate TypeScript types, React hooks, and other artifacts from your GraphQL schemas
- **Monorepo-Optimized**: Designed specifically for multi-project workspaces with shared GraphQL schemas and operations
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support for multiple GraphQL endpoints, custom plugins, and advanced generation options
- **Development Workflow**: Streamlined setup and generation processes that integrate seamlessly with Nx build systems

## Getting Started

### Installation

To add the `@nx-tools/nx-graphql-codegen` plugin to your Nx workspace, run the following command:

```package-install
npx nx add @nx-tools/nx-graphql-codegen
```

{/* This command will:
- Install the plugin package and its dependencies
- Configure the plugin within your Nx workspace
- Set up the necessary executors for GraphQL code generation operations */}

## Project Configuration

### Initial Setup

Configure GraphQL code generation for your application using the configuration generator:

```bash
nx g @nx-tools/nx-graphql-codegen:configuration <project-name>
```

This generator automatically sets up:
- **GraphQL Codegen Configuration**: Creates a `codegen.ts` file with sensible defaults for your project
- **Schema and Operations**: Configures paths for your GraphQL schema and operation files
- **Output Generation**: Sets up TypeScript type generation and other configured outputs
- **Nx Integration**: Adds pre-configured executors for running code generation as part of your build process

### Configuration Options

The generator supports various configuration options to match your GraphQL setup:
- **Schema Sources**: Configure multiple schema sources (local files, remote endpoints, or introspection)
- **Output Targets**: Generate TypeScript types, React hooks, Angular services, or custom outputs
- **Plugin Configuration**: Customize GraphQL Code Generator plugins and their settings

## Code Generation

### Basic Usage

To generate code from your GraphQL schema and operations:

```bash
nx codegen-generate <project-name>
```

This command will:
1. Read your GraphQL schema from configured sources
2. Process GraphQL operations and fragments
3. Generate TypeScript types and other configured outputs
4. Update generated files in your project

### Generation Workflow

**Development Process:**
1. Define your GraphQL schema (`.graphql` or `.gql` files)
2. Write GraphQL operations (queries, mutations, subscriptions)
3. Run `nx codegen-generate` to generate types and utilities
4. Import and use the generated types in your application code

**Continuous Integration:**
- Set up the generation as part of your build process
- Ensure generated code is always up-to-date with schema changes
- Validate that operations are compatible with the current schema

### Watch Mode

For continuous development, you can run the generator in watch mode to automatically regenerate code when schema or operations change:

```bash
nx codegen-generate <project-name> --watch
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Schema Sources

Configure multiple GraphQL endpoints or schema files:

```yaml title="codegen.yml"
schema:
  - 'https://api.example.com/graphql'
  - './libs/shared/schema/**/*.graphql'
generates:
  libs/api-types/src/generated/types.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - typescript-operations
```

### Custom Plugins

Extend code generation with custom plugins for specific frameworks or use cases:

```yaml title="codegen.yml"
generates:
  src/generated/graphql.tsx:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - typescript-operations
      - typescript-react-apollo
    config:
      withHooks: true
      withComponent: false
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Schema Management**: The plugin supports various schema sources including local files, remote GraphQL endpoints, and schema introspection. Configure multiple sources to aggregate schemas from different services.
