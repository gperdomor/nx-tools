The `@nx-tools/nx-prisma` plugin delivers a complete Prisma integration for Nx monorepos, offering streamlined database workflows, automated schema management, and powerful code generation capabilities that scale with your application architecture.

## Key Features

- **Complete Prisma CLI Integration**: Access all Prisma commands through Nx executors with proper dependency management
- **Intelligent Project Setup**: Automated generators that configure Prisma with best practices for monorepo environments
- **Database Workflow Management**: Streamlined migration, deployment, and schema synchronization processes
- **Development Tools Integration**: Built-in Prisma Studio access and validation workflows
- **Monorepo-Optimized**: Designed specifically for multi-project workspaces with shared database schemas

## Getting Started

### Installation

To add the `@nx-tools/nx-prisma` plugin to your Nx workspace, run the following command:

```package-install
npx nx add @nx-tools/nx-prisma
```

{/* This command will:
- Install the plugin package and its dependencies
- Configure the plugin within your Nx workspace
- Set up the necessary executors for Prisma operations */}

## Project Configuration

### Initial Setup

Configure Prisma for your application using the configuration generator:

```bash
nx g @nx-tools/nx-prisma:configuration <project-name>
```

This generator automatically sets up:
- **Prisma Schema**: Creates a `schema.prisma` file in your project root with sensible defaults
{/* - **Database Configuration**: Configures database connection and provider settings */}
- **Nx Targets**: Adds pre-configured executors for all common Prisma operations
{/* - **Development Workflow**: Sets up generators, migrations, and database management tasks */}

  **Schema Customization**: While the default configuration places the Prisma schema in the project root, you can relocate or rename your schema file. Ensure the `options.schema` property in your project targets reflects the correct relative path to maintain proper functionality.
</Callout>

## Available Operations

Once configured, you can execute comprehensive Prisma workflows using the following commands:

### Code Generation and Schema Management

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client and related artifacts
nx prisma-generate <project-name>

# Validate schema syntax and configuration
nx prisma-validate <project-name>
```

### Database Operations

```bash
# Deploy pending migrations to production database
nx prisma-deploy <project-name>

# Create and apply new migrations
nx prisma-migrate <project-name>

# Pull database schema changes to Prisma schema
nx prisma-pull <project-name>

# Push schema changes directly to database (development)
nx prisma-push <project-name>

# Populate your database with predefined data
nx prisma-seed <project-name>
```

### Development Tools

```bash
# Launch Prisma Studio for visual database management
nx prisma-studio <project-name>

# Format Prisma schema file
nx prisma-format <project-name>

# Reset the database and apply migrations
nx prisma-reset <project-name>

# Resolve Prisma schema conflicts
nx prisma-resolve <project-name>
```

### Command Usage Patterns

**Development Workflow:**
1. Modify your Prisma schema
2. Run `nx prisma-generate` to update the client
3. Use `nx prisma-push` for rapid prototyping or `nx prisma-migrate` for production-ready changes
4. Validate changes with `nx prisma-validate`

**Production Deployment:**
1. Apply migrations with `nx prisma-deploy`
2. Generate optimized client with `nx prisma-generate`
