## Unsupported CI Provider

If you're running your build in an unsupported provider, you can fallback to the local environment setting the environment variable `CI_CONTEXT_FALLBACK_TO_LOCAL=true`. With this change your build will run using the local git context, so `git` command is required to work.

## INPUT_BUILD_ARGS is not working

It's a common use case to pass build arguments to the docker command using environment variables, so the first thing you would run is something like this

```bash
INPUT_BUILD_ARGS=NODE_VERSION=14.17.5,NGINX_VERSION=1.21.3 npx nx run angular-app:docker
```

But as you can notice, it do not work as you expect ðŸ˜¢

The problem is because both variables should be separated by a new line instead a comma and you have two ways to do it

### Using dotenv

Create a `.env` file in the root of the workspace with this content

```
INPUT_BUILD_ARGS="NODE_VERSION=14.17.5-alpine\nNGINX_VERSION=1.21.3"
```

Take a look of the `\n` between both variables, then run `nx run angular:docker`

### Inline execution

Sadly, the string of the first option not work if you try to run `INPUT_BUILD_ARGS="NODE_VERSION=14.17.5-alpine\nNGINX_VERSION=1.21.3" nx run angular:docker`, in this case you need to use a new line instead of `\n` like the below image

## INPUT_TAGS is not working with container-metadata

This specific case is for the container-metadata tags, and is the same issue of [INPUT_BUILD_ARGS](#INPUT_BUILD_ARGS-is-not-working), please apply the same solutions described above
